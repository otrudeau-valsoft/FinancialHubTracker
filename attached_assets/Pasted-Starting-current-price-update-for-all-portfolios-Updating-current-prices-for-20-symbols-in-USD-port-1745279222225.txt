    This may happen intermittently and you should catch errors appropriately.
    However:  1) if this recently started happening on every request for a symbol
    that used to work, Yahoo may have changed their API.  2) If this happens on
    every request for a symbol you've never used before, but not for other
    symbols, you've found an edge-case (OR, we may just be protecting you from
    "bad" data sometimes stored for e.g. misspelt symbols on Yahoo's side).
    Please see if anyone has reported this previously:
    
      https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+QuoteSummaryResult
    
    or open a new issue (and mention the symbol):  yahoo-finance2 v2.13.3
    
      https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2/issues/new?labels=bug%2C+validation&template=validation.md&title=QuoteSummaryResult
    
    For information on how to turn off the above logging or skip these errors,
    see https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2/tree/devel/docs/validation.md.
    
    At the end of the doc, there's also a section on how to
    [Help Fix Validation Errors](https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2/blob/devel/docs/validation.md#help-fix)
    in case you'd like to contribute to the project.  Most of the time, these
    fixes are very quick and easy; it's just hard for our small core team to keep up,
    so help is always appreciated!
