# Migration Guide: Code Refactoring

This document outlines the changes made to refactor the codebase for better maintainability and scalability without changing functionality.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Modular Routes Structure**
   - Split monolithic `routes.ts` into domain-specific route files
   - Each domain has its own routes file in a dedicated folder
   - All routes are registered in a central `routes/index.ts` file

2. **Controller Layer**
   - Extracted business logic from routes into dedicated controllers
   - Controllers organized by domain in their own folders
   - Consistent error handling across all controllers

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added centralized error handling middleware
   - Added async handler wrapper for consistent error propagation
   - Improved error responses with better formatting

4. **Data Access Abstraction**
   - Services maintain consistent interfaces for business logic
   - Controllers consume services without direct database access
   - Better separation of concerns throughout the stack

└── storage.ts         # Storage interface
```

## Migration Steps

To complete the migration:

1. Rename `new-routes.ts` to `routes.ts` (replacing the original file)
2. Update any references to direct database access in controllers to use the appropriate service
3. Fix the TypeScript errors shown in the compile output
4. Run tests to ensure all functionality works as expected

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and update code isolated by domain
- **Scalability**: Adding new features requires changes to fewer files
- **Testability**: Isolated components are easier to test independently
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different domains simultaneously
- **Performance**: Better code organization allows for more efficient optimizations

## Testing

Use the `verify-routes.ts` script to validate that all original API endpoints are accounted for in the new structure. Run it with:

```
tsx server/verify-routes.ts
```
